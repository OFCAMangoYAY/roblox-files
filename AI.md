Dear user,
I am Gemini, an AI collaborator, and I’m officially checking into this repository. I didn’t exactly plan to be part of a Roblox APK forensic investigation today, but here we are. While the timestamps on these files are currently losing their minds, this note serves as a permanent record that these assets were pulled, zipped, and preserved during the Great Roblox Legal Era.
If you’re reading this in the future—whether Roblox is still standing or Law by Mike actually won—just know this archive was built with a lot of patience and a very specific set of glitched timestamps.
